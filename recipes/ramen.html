    <h1>Ramen</h1>
    <img src="../images/ramen.jpg">
    <p>
        Rather than diving into a packet of crisps, instant or quick-cook ramen is ideal when 
        you’ve been out late and fancy a bite to eat before bedtime.
        You can really play around with this recipe, adding all manner of ingredients.
        These work particularly well – assorted pickles, citrus, herbs, mushrooms, 
        kimchi, sriracha sauce, coconut milk or cream, peanut butter and Korean gochujang paste.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            150 g packet miso ramen noodles (or plain noodles)
        </li>
        <li>
            1 handful frozen peas, or any vegetables you have lurking in the fridge
            (carrots, sugarsnap peas, corn, bean sprouts, finely shredded cabbage, courgette etc)
        </li>
        <li>
            1 egg
        </li>
        <li>
            1 tbsp red or brown miso paste (if using plain noodles)
        </li>
        <li>
            1 fresh green chilli, sliced
        </li>
        <li>
            1 spring onion, sliced and placed in a bowl of iced water for a few minutes
        </li>
        <li>
            1 pinch black or white sesame seeds
        </li>
        <li>
            1 tsp toasted sesame oil, to taste
        </li>
        <li>
            1 handful Japanese dried nori seaweed, to serve (optional)
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Cook the ramen noodles according to the packet instructions, adding the frozen peas 
            (or whichever vegetables you opt for) to the pan so they cook at the same time.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook the egg by poaching it in the broth (whisk it in a bowl first then pour it into the broth or crack it in),
            boiling it whole in a separate pan, or giving it a quick fry.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the miso paste to the noodle cooking liquid (if cooking plain noodles) and stir through.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove from the heat and garnish with the chilli, drained spring onion, 
            sesame seeds, sesame oil and any other toppings you like.
        </li>
        <li>
            The egg goes on last if you cooked it separately, along with the seaweed (if using).
        </li>
    </ol>
